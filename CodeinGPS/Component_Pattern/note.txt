Component Pattern Design

GameObject: Components

decouping pattern: allow component to span multiple demain
base structm new types

Container: 
Constructer, interface

Add and retrieve components
enum class ComponentType{..,..,..};

Pro:
Flexibility at runtime to add or remove components
Compromise: 
Only store 1 type of each component
Cons:
not meet our secondary goal of performance, cache issue remain,
still lots of indirection

Oriented Design:
